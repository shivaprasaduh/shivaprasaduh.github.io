I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](www.iitm.ac.in). 

My main research interests are in superconducting circuits for quantum information processing and photonic quantum technologies. I am motivated by research works in both theoritical and experimental domains in the above fields. My current work focuses on the spread of information in Dual-Unitary circuits. I have previous worked on botht the experimental as well as theoritical aspects related to making the present generation of qubits more robust.


I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this research field and contribute to groundbreaking research.

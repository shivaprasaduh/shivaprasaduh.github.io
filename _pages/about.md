I'm an applied physicist from IIT Madras. My main research interest is in superconducting circuits for quantum information processing and photonic quantum technologies. I am motivated by research works in both theoritical and experimental domains in the above fields.
I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this research field and contribute to groundbreaking research.

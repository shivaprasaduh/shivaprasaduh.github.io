Analysed the topological Cellular Automaton Decoders using only local update rules and its application in Quantum Error Correcting Codes. I simulated for different architectures and designs in the stabilizer formalism on the Toric Code and applied sweep rules to get a high threshold rates. The link to the original Phys. Rev.

Achieved high fiber to source (microring resonator) coupling efficiency. Demonstrated high signal-to-noise ratio
performance for the resonator using AWG-based pulse waveform optimization techniques. Performed classical and
quantum measurements to determine the chip performance metrics such as losses, spectral and temporal features, purity. I also worked on Quantum Random Number Generator setup to obtain experimental data.
The internship program was supported by MITACS.
